			"- Do not repeat the same tool call with identical arguments unless the workspace changed or the prior result was errored, truncated, or clearly incomplete.\n" +
			"- After a successful write or edit, do at most one focused verification call; if that verifies the change, stop calling tools and respond.\n" +
			"- If a successful tool result already answers the question or confirms completion, stop using tools and give the user the result.\n" +
